# market_alerts

Easily set simple alerts for your watchlist with this alert module!

How to Use:
1. First make sure you have an API key from AlphaVantage, it is 100% free to use with I believe up to 5 API calls/minute.
2. For good practice, set a Google app password. Navigate to your google account settings > security > app passwords. From here you can create a new app password to paste into this alert module.
3. Declare your alert settings and call .run()! For in-depth explanations refer to docs.txt or read the code.
