3. Plug in your api key, email, and app password. Now you are all set to start creating alerts!

Creating an alert:
Start by creating an alert object: alert = Alert()
- Declare any settings you wish when creating it such as: Alert(symbol='aapl', alert='signal', logic='MA Crossover')
If you wish to set alert logic parameters you are able to with Alert.set_logic_params(**kwargs)

Alert functionality:
There are currently three alert types which can be declared as you create the alert object.
'Signal' is for long/short signals using indicators
'Stock' is for stock events
'Position' is for position updates; you will need to input the start date of your position

The logic parameter is the indicator used for signals
'MA Crossover' uses up to 3 moving averages and their crossover for bullish/bearish alerts
'MACD' uses 2 moving averages and their difference for bullish/bearish alerts
'Price' alerts you when the asset moves past your declared price
'Position' alerts you when your position is up/down X%
