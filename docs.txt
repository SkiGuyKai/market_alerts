Alert Module Documentation

Getting Started:
1. Ensure you have an API key from AlphaVantage; https://www.alphavantage.co/support/#api-key
2. (Optional) Create a Google app password from your Google account security settings
3. Plug in your api key (line 17), email (line 132), and app password (line 134). Now you are all set to start creating alerts!

Creating an alert:
Start by creating an alert object: alert = Alert()
- Declare any settings you wish when creating it such as: Alert(symbol='aapl', alert='Signal', logic='MA Crossover')
If you wish to set alert logic parameters you are able to with Alert.set_logic_params(**kwargs)

Alert functionality:
The alert parameter is optional as it is only used for notification clarity (notif. heading). Here's what I reccommend:
'Signal' for long/short signals using indicators
'Stock' for stock events
'Position' for position updates; you will need to input the start date of your position (future update)

The logic parameter is the indicator used for signals, there are 4 currently:
1. 'MA Crossover' uses up to 3 moving averages and their crossover for bullish/bearish alerts
2. 'MACD' uses 2 moving averages and their difference for bullish/bearish alerts
3. 'Price' alerts you when the asset moves past your declared price
4. 'Position' alerts you when your position is up/down X% (future update)
